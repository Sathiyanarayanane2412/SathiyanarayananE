100 Days Basic Coding Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days Basic Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to help beginners build a strong foundation in coding by committing to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days. Whether you're completely new to coding or looking to strengthen your skills, this challenge is for you!

How It Works

Commitment: Dedicate at least an hour every day to coding.
Choose Your Language: Pick a programming language to focus on. Popular options include Python, JavaScript, Java, or any language you're interested in learning.
Projects and Exercises: Work on projects and coding exercises to apply what you've learned. You can find plenty of resources online, including coding platforms, tutorials, and books.
Document Your Progress: Keep track of your daily progress. This could be through a journal, blog, or social media. Sharing your journey can help motivate others and hold yourself accountable.
Support and Community: Join online coding communities or forums to connect with others who are also taking the challenge. You can share your struggles, ask for help, or celebrate your successes together.

Getting Started
Fork this Repository: Start by forking this repository to track your progress.
Set Goals: Define your goals for the challenge. What do you want to accomplish by the end of 100 days? Whether it's building a portfolio of projects, mastering a specific concept, or preparing for a coding interview, having clear goals will keep you motivated.
Daily Updates: Create a daily log where you document what you worked on, challenges you faced, and lessons learned. You can use the provided template or create your own format.
Stay Consistent: Consistency is key to success. Even on busy days, try to squeeze in some coding time, even if it's just for a few minutes.
